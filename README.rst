PyVOLTHA-min is an updated pyVOLTHA package that provides a collection
of python 3.x libraries used to create an VOLTHA OLT device adapter
focused on the VOLTHA v2.4 release and beyond.

As some adapters (including the OpenONU) have required to be moved to
the Go language, there is was not as much maintenance performed on the
pyVOLTHA package.

The goal for this package is to begin to deprecate and remove old
VOLTHA 1.x features and focus on a minimal set of updated imports that can
be supported in Python 3.6+ with the hopes to transition to later versions
of python. In addition, effort to remove any GPL or other restrictive
package requirements is also highly desired.

Installation instruction
------------------------

.. code:: bash

   pip install pyvoltha-min

Release Notes
-------------
v2.8.0 (2022-02-01)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Pull in v2.8 (release) voltha-protos definitions and python generated code and
   cleaned up any pylint issues.  Several 'FIXME' declarations made to track issues
   that need to be addressed.  Primary reason for creation is to help with v2.8
   development alongside a python device adapter.
 - pylint cleanups so new version issues are easier to identify

v2.7.4 (2021-04-01)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Remove dependency on arrow module, use python 3's time builtin module instead

v2.7.3 (2021-03-24)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Dropping support for python 3.5.  Recommend 3.8 at this time as it is the focus of the
   most testing so far.
 - Upgraded twisted version to 21.2.0.  Will be looking at better ContextVar support for
   maintaining OpenTracing context in future version.  See Twisted 21.2.0 release notes for
   more information.  Also allows for official support of Python 3.8
 - Upgrade to latest Arrow release.  Eventually arrow may be removed in order to use latest
   versions of python time modules.

v2.7.2 (2021-03-01)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Support independent group poll frequencies.  Default still 15 seconds.  Zero group
   frequency to disable that group. Zero default frequency to disable all groups

v2.7.1 (2021-02-25)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - IAdapter API get_ext_value() and single_get_value_request() support
 - Do not report KPI metric if not supported by adapter (return of None)
 - pylint cleanup (adapter_request_facade.py primarily)

v2.7.0 (2021-02-23)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Updated to latest voltha-protos (4.0.13), protobuf (3.15.0), structlog (21.1.0),
   and PyYAML (5.4.1). Update of confluent-kafka to latest is planned after moving
   python version to 3.9 in order to pick up newer libraries but no date has been
   made for that yet.
 - Changed default kvstore prefix from service/voltha to service/voltha_voltha to match
   new multi-VOLTHA stack syntax for v2.7
 - Support passing of optional kv-store timeout to various components that use the kv-store

v2.6.5 (2021-02-19)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Added timeout for inter-container response (60 seconds) to help insure that the response
   transaction ID map does not grow unbounded. Future release will provide ability to customize
   this timeout on a per proxy (core/adapter topic) basis

v2.6.4 (2021-02-18)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Rounding kafka stats to microseconds for better readability
 - Made kafka-stats more generic to allow per topic/rpc-name totals and averages
 - Optimized kafka RCP encode/decode wrt Tracing if it is not enabled

v2.6.3 (2021-02-12)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Rollback confluent-kafka version

v2.6.2 (2021-02-12)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Added Kafka proxy statistics to help support scaling efforts
 - Changed producer 'poll' after 'produce' call to a periocic 'flush'
   to lower outstanding threads that could be blocking on the client.
 - Modified call parameters to kafka producer send related methods to allow
   for no response to be expected and to control timeout and retries beyond the
   default (if a response is requested).
 - Dropped unused etcd classes (kv_client, kvstore) to minimize number of ways
   etcd can be used.  Eventually the blocking etcd client used by the Resource
   manager will be deprecated and removed as well.  Remaining etcd classes consolidated
   to same directory as others.

v2.6.1 (2021-01-27)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - BUGFIX: had parameters in TechProfileInstance restore function swapped.

 - Change PM config frequency from units of 1/10 second to 1 second to match the
   voltha-lib-go implementation.

 - instance_id field in structured logging is instanceId in Go adapters.  Changing to
   that so that searching logs in EFK for only VOLTHA related logs can use that field
   name for all types of adapters (and other VOLTHA components)

 - A few incremental improvements to the tracing support

v2.6.0 (2021-01-25)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Moved TechProfile and ResourceManager string constants to pyvoltha_min files since
   OpenOLT diverged and places brackets '{}' around various elements.  This is needed
   by python OLT device adapters to work with the OpenONU-go device adapter

 - Customized TechProfile JSON serialization to only output fields ONU can use and
   expects.  Previous code was causing un-marshaling error in OpenONU-go device adapter.
   An additional change is that they 'is_multicast' boolean is expected to be encoded
   as a string in the JSON output.

 - TechProfileInstance creation (or restore from JSON) is now accomplished through
   either the create() or restore() static methods.  This allows a bit more explicit
   control on how the object is used in order to better control lifetime and use
   within an OLT device adapter.

-  The technology profile changes have been tested against both the Python and Go
   versions of the v2.6 OpenONU device adapter.

v2.5.6 (2021-01-20)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Added kv_store_prefix.py to allow for saving/retrieving kv-store prefix so that
   multiple voltha stacks can use the same kv-store infrastructure. Use KvStore.prefix
   instead of hardcoded 'service/voltha'
 - Fixed PM metric metadata titles to match what is expected by the 'kafka-topic-exporter'.
   Was using 'Ethernet' and 'PON' and should have been 'ETHERNET_NNI' and 'PON_OLT'

v2.5.5 (2021-01-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Support kv-store persistence & watching on log features prefixes
 - Removal of NilScope since OpenTracing API will always provide at least a nop
   tracer when requested via global_tracer() call.
 - Moved Tracing Support class to log_controller as that is the proper
   area in kv-store to watch/control for tracing and log correlation

v2.5.4 (2021-01-11)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Bugfix: Corrected trace-id and scan-id output to log. Should be hex lowercase
           values instead of integers
 - Corrected release date. v2.5.2 and v2.5.3 both had 2022 as the year

v2.5.3 (2021-01-08)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - Moving to Python 3.8 as base version for PIP virtual environment installs. But
   version 3.5+ are also okay to use in your end product.  Mainly chose 3.8 since
   it is a fairly recent version and there are performance improvements in the later
   versions as well that I want to make use of in the OLT adapters that use this
   library
 - Bug fixes/improvements to OpenTracing API calls to better align with OpenOLT & Core
 - Pylint cleanup in a number of files

v2.5.2 (2021-01-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Upgraded VOLTHA protos to v4.0.7.  This is the latest as of 1/4/2021 and is post-
   v2.6 release but all changes between the v2.5 release do not cause an issue with
   v2.5 OLT device adapters (python) and will allow for easier support of v2.6 features
   such as the individual get/set value requests (which are ONU-only at this time)
 - Added IAdapter support for single_get/set_value_request
 - Added initial jaeger tracing (basic support) for log correlation and trace
   needs in VOLTHA v2.5+ adapters.  Basic support includes root spans on
   adapter originated requests and simple child span support on incoming kafka
   requests.  More elaborate scope/context support is scheduled for a future
   version as having a trace that has an overall-span length with actual async
   work sub-spans are a bit more complex to implement.

v2.5.1 (2020-12-21)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Support for force-delete adapter
 - Added jaeger-client for log correlation and span support
 - Added get_ext_value() IAdapter interface

v2.5.0 (2020-12-21)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Upgraded Voltha-protos requirements to 4.0.5 tag. This is the VOLTHA v2.5 tag
   plus 3 additional protobuf changes from VOLTHA v2.6 that will have little impact
   until additional capabilities are added to device adapters that need them.

v2.4.7 (2020-12-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Endpoint Manager work to properly read out instances when adapter scaling had been performed
 - Extended interadapter IAdapter interface to pass along the 'from-adapter' topic to allow for
   auto-learning of ONU device adapter endpoint.

v2.4.6 (2020-12-03)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Added Rx/Tx frame-size (buckets) counters to NNI and PON statistics
 - Deprecated IndexPool, IdGeneration, docker_helpers, MessageQueue, and a majority
   of the common.config files (only EtcdStore in config_backend.py is still in use)
   EtcdStore will be deprecated in the near future and replaced with the async version
   (TwistedEtcdStore)

v2.4.5 (2020-12-01)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Require kv_store instance during instantiation of a onu single-instance tech profiler
 - Config backend list() method should return the generator that etcd returned

v2.4.5 (2020-11-25)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - More work to on twisted TimeoutError. It actually is defined as a class with the
   same name in more than one module.

v2.4.4 (2020-11-23)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Use Twisted TimeoutError exception rather than defining own Exception class
 - Improved timeout handling/error checking of inter-adapter exceptions to minimize
   additional exceptions being thrown by twisted reactor while in an inlineCallback
 - Work to support base python version of 3.8.5+.  Needs more work in pyYAML and
   the confluent-kafka modules to support 3.8 of python
 - Cleanup of remaining warnings (all low) identified by bandit
 - Move Development Status classifier to level 5 - Production/Stable
 - Dropped simplejson and docker-py packages as they are not needed

v2.4.3 (2020-11-19)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Added some reasonable max/min values on the PM Config frequency & skew
 - ONU and GEM Port stats are optional and not configured by default to match what
   the OpenOLT currently supports

v2.4.2 (2020-11-18)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Updated requirements (most notably confluent-kafka) to latest versions
 - Kafka requests now run in their own tasks
 - Support alarm (ONU Signal Fail) if deregistation due to degraded signal occurs

v2.4.1 (2020-11-16)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Updated requirements (most notably txaioetcd) to latest versions
 - Provide optional etcd change watch callback to be specified by external user
 - Allow watch callback to work for a prefix (more efficient with logger callbacks)

v2.4.0 (2020-10-29)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - Initial v2.4 release

v2.0.9 (2020-10-28)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Lowered log message level for twisted-etcd-store success calls.

v2.0.8 (2020-10-22)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- For async/twisted ETCD client, differentiate between a cancelled async request and true failure
- Start method for PM metrics will check to for an existing running LoopingCall before attempting
  to start the loop (which would assert otherwise if already running)

v2.0.7 (2020-10-13)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for Device Event serialization to support HA reconciliation after
  a container restart

v2.0.6 (2020-10-12)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Check to not stop looping call in stats if not running. Prevents an assert
- EtcStore errback should return the reason, not raise an assert
- Additional work on logger level and components in preparation for v2.5+ support
- Update to reported KPI Metrics to better match what OpenOLT supports in v2.4
- Allow None to be passed as key to TwistedEtcdStore operations to select the base client path
  and allow a timeout when initializing the etcd client.

v2.0.5 (2020-10-06)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fix bad check on OperStatus type. Always passed in as an int
- Fix log keyword bug, should not use 'event' in call
- Disable GEM Port statistics until we are ready for them

v2.0.4 (2020-10-05)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Deprecation of HeartBeat Event, now called OLT Indication
- Correct subcategory for OLT LOS Event (was ONU, should be OLT)
- Corrected Device Events for OLT LOS, OLT Port Down, OLT Down, Dying
  Gasp, and PON Interface Down events for the OLT (VOLTHA v2.x format)
- A small amount of pylint cleanup and python 3 updates
- Call to etcd callback needs to be placed onto reactor thread

v2.0.3 (2020-09-30)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Call to etcd callback needs to be placed onto reactor thread

v2.0.2 (2020-09-28)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Default KPI subcategory is now OLT and can be set with a kwargs if needed
   for some other type
-  Moved to latest version of protobuf module
-  Added golang-equivalent Endpoint Manager in effort to determine endpoint
   of a device for interadapter-messages.  Turns out there is a flaw in the
   design and is reliant upon use of a specific golang 3rd party hashing
   algorythm which may not be available to a python program.  Discussions
   on the VOLTHA slack channel have been started and a JIRA may be issued
   in the near future.
-  Added 'list' function for ectd library

v2.0.1 (2020-09-24)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Move etcd/kafka address values to be similar to what OpenOLT uses
-  Small amount of 'assert' cleanup flagged by bandit


v2.0.0 (2020-09-20)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Pre-release with all but Alarms/Events and logging up to date
   with v2.4 release of VOLTHA
-  Much refactoring of python 2.7 code with movement toward at
   least python 3.5 and later supported
-  Dropped import of __future__ and six (to some extent)
-  Removed simple ONU-only device events related to OMCI
-  Dropped transitions, pcapy, and scapy imports (no longer required)
-  Added missing 'child_device_lost' IAdapter RPC as well as
   a few other IAdapter and inter-adapter API bit rot cleaned up
